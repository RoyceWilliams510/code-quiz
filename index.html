                        and you will have to respond to them as quickly as possible. If you answer a question incorrectly 5 points will be subtracted
                        from your  score. If you answer a question correctly then 5 points will be added to your  score. Once all of the questions 
                        have been answered, the remaining time left on the quiz will be added to your score and that will be the final score. Good Luck!
